## About the deck origins

This deck was initially [uploaded](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2915332392) to the AnkiWeb shared decks repository.
What makes this deck remarkable is two things: the quality of the used maps and its simplicity.

The deck was last updated in 2013th and since then it was left unmaintained. It has acquired a number of
user comments but they're getting lost in vain since nobody developing this deck anymore. Apparently the problem
is in Anki data format of shared decks since it doesn't suggest any collaboration or development. Fortunately it's been
changed recently.

**First**, thanks to [CrowdAnki add-on](https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki) it's now possible to
export decks in JSON format which brings us to the intelligible ground of version control systems and righteous collaboration.

**Second**, the deck was further ported onto [Anki Deck Manger](https://github.com/OnkelTem/anki-dm) framework which
provides additional levels of detalization and flexibility.

## Changes to the original deck

There is the list of changes comparing to the original deck:

1. The deck has been divided into two parts: Capitals and Maps & Flags, each one containing the
information needed for studying this particular type of things. For example the Capitals decks doesn't have
images at all and thus is very small.
1. Two new Wikipedia link fields have been added - for Countries and Capitals. Whenever you want to read 
more about a country or a city - just click the "[i]" icon. 
1. The images have been optimized - the overall size has been reduced by 30%, from 19MB down to 13MB.

## Translation status

The Croatian country names were in the original deck so it was ported here without any changes.
